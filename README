Introduction
------------
This is a SOCKS client module that can communicate with SOCKS v4 and
v5 servers.  It currently allows you to make outgoing and incoming 
TCP connections.  UDP is not yet supported and is first on the TODO
list.  Included in this distribution is a sample program called
"example" to show you how to use this module.  Net::SOCKS
documentation is available on your system by doing a
"perldoc Net::SOCKS".
